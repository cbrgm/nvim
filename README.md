>My nvim configuration with the aim of not cluttering nvim with plugins unnecessarily and instead improving the core functions of Vim with some Quality of Life plugins.

## Terminal

This setup works well with the following `Alacritty` terminal config

```yaml
colors:
  primary:
    background: '#1F1F28'
window:
  opacity: 0.98
  decorations: none
font:
  size: 14
  normal:
    family: Hack Nerd Font Mono
    style: Regular
  bold:
    family: Hack Nerd Font Mono
    style: Bold
  italic:
    family: Hack Nerd Font Mono
    style: Italic
```
